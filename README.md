# Bignum-Arithmetics #
Simple calculator for numbers that overflow all numeric types in C#

This is a small self-educational project I decided to start in order to refresh memories of writing in C#. The final result gonna be reached by smaller steps:

[DONE] 0. Learn more about git functionality (branches)

[DONE] 0.1. Learn how to use git with Visual Studio 2017

[AWAITING] 1.0. Set up project environment. Implement Interface\Abstract class for storing numbers. Create three classes with operators overloading that inherit from the interface. These are : fixed point, fractional and 2..16-base numbers.

// I decided to delay implementing of classes except fixed point until the class structure is better defined.

<b>[CURRENT]</b> 1.1. Implement simple reading and storing either from a console and file.

[AWAITING] 1.2. Start creating simple documentation

[AWAITING] 2.0. Implement long sum and long dif for integers. Remember to proceed negative and zero numbers.

[AWAITING] 3.0. Implement basic error management using exception system.

[AWAITING] 4.0. Implement long mul. Try these methods: classic, Karatsuba, Schönhage–Strassen, Fürer’s algo

[AWAITING] 4.1. Implement pow

[AWAITING] 4.2. Implement factorial

[AWAITING] 5.0. Implement div

[AWAITING] 6.0. Implement mod for integers. Remember to create exception. Or fmod?

[AWAITING] 7.0. Implement 2-6 for fixed point

[AWAITING] 7.1. Implement 2-6 for fractional. Remember about reduction of fractions(solution is factorization...)

[AWAITING] 7.2. Implement 2-6 for different base

[AWAITING] 7.3. Create a config file to configure current parameters of testing. Create endless looped menu of reading input, like a local console.

[MAYBE] 8.0 Try to implement a normal calculator, with brackets support. Look at stack-like collections. Regex? RPN? Class Expression. What if mul overflow?

[MAYBE] 9.0. Try to implement multithreading. It can be used with low-level operations, parsing etc.

[MAYBE] 10.0. Learn how to use LINQ. Create DB with tests, that contain different test parameters. Implement some choice criterias (speed, length, errors) and write sql queries to add and get them from db, run and display results. //. Maybe I should sleep more :D

[MAYBE] 11.0. I need to learn more about ASP.NET, so... try to involve it somehow. Maybe add some cryptography for this (triple des, rsa)

YET INVOLVED: regex, delegates+events, design patterns, parallel computing, async prog, what is reflection?

----------

If anyone ever visits this project, any kind of feedback is highly appreciated (task ideas or literature propositions, code quality or architecture comments)
