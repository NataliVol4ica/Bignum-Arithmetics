# Bignum-Arithmetics #
Simple calculator for numbers that overflow all numeric types in C#

This is a small self-educational project I decided to start in order to refresh memories of writing in C#. The final result gonna be reached by smaller steps:

[DONE] 0. Learn how to use git with Visual Studio 2017 :D

[DONE] 1.0. Implement Interface\Abstract class for storing numbers. Child classes will be : integer, fixed point, fractional, 2..16-base and maybe literal numbers.

[DONE] 1.1. Implement simple reading and storing either from a console and file.

[DONE] 2.0. Implement long sum

[DONE] 2.1. Start creating documentation

[DONE] 2.2. Implement long dif. Remember to proceed negative and zero numbers.

[DONE] 3.0. Implement basic error management using exception system + advanced input parsing.

[DONE] 3.1. Write more tests

[DONE] 4.0. Implement long mul. //rejected pow and factorial because not so useful

[DONE] 5.0. Implement div

[DONE] 5.1. Test Div

[DONE] 5.2. Implement mod

[DONE] 6.0. Implement more useful methods (copy etc)

[DONE] 6.1. Append documentation

[DONE] 7.0. Implement 2-6 for integer.

[DELAYED] 7.1. Implement 2-6 for different base

[DELAYED] 7.2. Implement 2-6 for fractional. Remember about reduction of fractions(factorization...)

[DONE] 8.0. Try to implement a normal calculator, with brackets support. Look at stack-like collections. Regex? RPN? Class Expression. What if mul overflow?

<b>[CURRENT]</b> 8.1. Add testing and documentation

[MAYBE] 9.0. Simplicity? Pow? Exp? Log?

If anyone ever visits this project, any kind of feedback is highly appreciated (task ideas or literature propositions, code quality or architecture comments)
