# Bignum-Arithmetics #
Simple calculator for numbers that overflow all numeric types in C#

This is a small self-educational project I decided to start in order to refresh memories of writing in C#. The final result gonna be reached by smaller steps:

[DONE] 0. Learn more about git functionality (branches)

[DONE] 0.1. Learn how to use git with Visual Studio 2017

[DONE] 1.0. Set up project environment. Implement Interface\Abstract class for storing numbers. Create classes with operators overloading that inherit from the interface. These are : fixed point, fractional and 2..16-base numbers.

[DONE] 1.1. Implement simple reading and storing either from a console and file.

[DONE] 2.0. Implement long sum

[DONE] 2.1. Start creating documentation

[DONE] 2.2. Implement long dif. Remember to proceed negative and zero numbers.

[DONE] 3.0. Implement basic error management using exception system + advanced input parsing.

[DONE] 3.1. Write more tests

[DONE] 4.0. Implement long mul. //rejected pow and factorial because not so useful

[DONE] 5.0. Implement div

<b>[CURRENT]</b> 5.1. Test Div

[AWAITING] 5.2. Implement mod. Remember to create exception. fmod?

[AWAITING] 6.0. Implement more useful methods (copy etc)

[AWAITING] 6.1. Append documentation

[AWAITING] 7.0. Implement 2-6 for integer.

[AWAITING] 7.1. Implement 2-6 for different base

[AWAITING] 7.2. Implement 2-6 for fractional. Remember about reduction of fractions(factorization...)

[AWAITING] 7.3. Create a config file to configure current parameters of testing. Create endless looped menu of reading input, like a local console.

[AWAITING] 8.0. Try to implement a normal calculator, with brackets support. Look at stack-like collections. Regex? RPN? Class Expression. What if mul overflow?

[AWAITING] 8.1. Improve input error management

[MAYBE] 9.0. Try to implement multithreading. It can be used with low-level operations, parsing etc.

[MAYBE] 10.0. Cryptography? (triple des, rsa). Simplicity?

[MAYBE] 11.0. LINQ? ASP.NET?

YET INVOLVED: delegates+events, parallel computing, async prog

If anyone ever visits this project, any kind of feedback is highly appreciated (task ideas or literature propositions, code quality or architecture comments)
